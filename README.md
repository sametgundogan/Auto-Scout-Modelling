# Auto-Scout-Modelling

Welcome to "Car Price Prediction Project". This is my first medium project of Machine Learning course. In this project I will apply many algorithms
commonly used for regression problems.

Also, I will apply various processes such as pre-processing, train-test spilit and cross validation that I will use in algorithm modeling and prediction
processes in Python with scikit-learn.

I implemented Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression,and Elastic-Net algorithms respectively . Lastly, I measured the success of my models
with regression evaluation metrics as well as with cross validation method.

I hope it might be useful for thoes who still learning machine learning models, like me.

Enjoy...
